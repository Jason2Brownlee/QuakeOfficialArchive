## About This Project

Quake is a computer game released by id Software in 1996.

A number of subsequent patches, mission packs and source code releases were made between 1996 and 2000.

Many people released modified versions of the game code, called Quake modifications or simply "mods".

It may not be clear which version of the game code was used for a given mod. As such, having an archive of all official releases along with the date of release can help to nail down the version of code used by a mod.
