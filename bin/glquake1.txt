 1. INTRODUCTION

 This version of the PowerVR GL driver is ONLY for Quake I and Hexen II. With
 this driver you can now enjoy the improved graphics quality of the OpenGL
 option in Quake I on your PowerVR card. This driver, or an updated version
 of it, should also work with most, if not all, coming games based on the
 Quake I engine.

 This driver is unsupported. However we welcome any comments or reports of
 bugs that you may have. These should be sent to the email address above.

 NOTE: This driver is not an OpenGL driver. It is only an implementation of
 a subset of the OpenGL API, sufficient to run GLQuake I and its derivatives.
 It is not certified by Silicon Graphics Inc. and has not passed any OpenGL
 conformance tests. Do not attempt to use this driver with OpenGL
 applications other than those based on the Quake engine, or those which
 claim to work with a "GLQuake driver".


 2. INCLUDED FILES

 OPENGL32.DLL - The PowerVR GL driver for Quake I and Hexen II
 README.TXT   - This file.


 3. REQUIREMENTS

 This driver requires the following to be installed and running
 on the system:

 * Any version of Windows 95
 * DirectX 3.0a or later
 * PowerVR Windows 95 drivers version 4.0.1 or later
 * Quake I or Hexen II

 The following is the recommended minimum system requirements:

 * A Pentium 133 or better CPU.
 * 32 Megabytes of RAM.
 * A PowerVR PCX2 card such as the Apocalypse 3Dx or the Matrox m3D.

 NOTE: Because this driver uses the FPU (floating point unit) of the CPU
       extensively, current non-Intel x86 compatible processors require a
       significantly higher clock rate than 133 MHz to match the performance
       of a Pentium 133.


 4. INSTALLATION

 WARNING: Do not copy the driver into your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory as this
 will prevent other OpenGL applications running on your system, including the
 Windows OpenGL screen savers.

 * Install the game.
 * Put the OPENGL32.DLL file from THIS archive into your game's directory.
 * From the Video options menu, select "PowerVR OpenGL" as your video driver.
   Check the 8-bit texture option as "Yes."
   Move the cursor to "Apply" and hit the [Enter] key.


 5. A NOTE FOR PCX1 USERS

 The GL option in Quake I requires bilinear filtering for implementing
 lighting. Unfortunately PCX1 does not support bilinear filtering and
 as such, the lighting in the Quake I does not look as good. In addition,
 performance on PCX1 is significantly slower than on PCX2. Apocalypse
 3D users may wish to upgrade to the Apocalypse 3Dx. The competitively
 priced Matrox m3D also provides a possible upgrade path.


 6. USING DIFFERENT SCREEN MODES

 To switch between 16, 24 and 32 bit color depths, you need to change the
 color depth of your desktop. The Quake II test demo will automatically run at the
 color depth of your desktop.

 Do not be afraid of 24 bit mode if you are running at lower resolutions.
 Providing your 2D video card is reasonably fast and has enough memory to
 support the specified mode with triple buffering, 24 bit mode incurs
 little or no performance hit.


 7. ADJUSTING THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS OR GAMMA

 On many systems, the default brightness of Quake II is too dark.
 The game allows you to adjust the brightness.  If you prefer more brightness,
 also try the following:

 * Increasing the contrast and brightness settings on your monitor.
 * Some 2D cards allow boosting the gamma via the Windows 95 Display
   Properties page. Sometimes these setting won't "stick" between changes in
   resolution, so you might have to switch to the resolution you want to play
   at (e.g. 640x480), adjust the gamma, then start the game.


 8. PERFORMANCE TUNING

 While the performance is generally very good, for hard-core players
 want every little bit of extra performance possible. The following tips can be
 very helpful:

 * If you have a system with good FPU performance such as an Intel CPU with
   a high clock speed, try running at 512x384.
 * Because of the large amount of memory that the game uses, there can quite
   often be considerable paging to disk causing
   annoying pauses in the game. These can be minimized by making sure no
   other applications are running in the background. Modifying your virtual
   memory settings to use a large permanent swap file can also increase
   performance. Virtual memory settings are adjusted in the System applet
   in the Windows 95 Control Panel. You should also run Disk Defragmenter
   on your hard drive before creating a permanent swap file.
 * Make sure that, in the Video options menu, you've selected 8-bit textures
   under OpenGL.  This helps reduce the amount of memory used.
 * Run the game fullscreen.
