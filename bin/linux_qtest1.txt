This is Quake for Linux.  It was compiled and tested under an ELF 1.3.62
system with the tasd-3.5-beta7 sound code, using gcc 2.7.0 and
libc.so.5.0.9.  You must first download the qtest1.zip package (you can
find it at quake.best.com:/pub/idsoftware) and unpack that in a
directory.  Then, place the xquake executable in that directory and run
it from there.  You must be able to run ELF applications.

This version of Quake requires that you have the new mmapable sound
driver.  You can find the sound code at tasd-3.5-beta7.tar.gz from
ftp.best.com/pub/front/tasd.  This code allows Quake to memory-map the
sound DMA buffer, eliminating a seperate sound process, lowering
latency, and better-modelling DOS code.

A version called xf86quake, featuring the new DGA code should be
available shortly.  DGA allows direct access to the frame buffer, page
flipping, proper mouse behavior, and proper keyboard behavior.  The X
server required to support DGA, XFree86 beta 3.1.2D, should also be
available in a few days.

In the meantime, the regular X version, without mouse support, is quite
fast, and I recommend a low X resolution such as 320x200 to enjoy better
immersion.

There are no Linux-specific command-line options, variables, or
commands, beyond what is mentioned in the sound.txt file.

The purpose of this release is to test for bugs & compatability
problems.  Please do not send comments back to personal e-mail accounts.
They will be ignored.  Submit bug reports to qtest1@idsoftware.com.
