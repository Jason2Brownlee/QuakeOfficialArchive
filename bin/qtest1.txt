Here it is, the first public TEST of Quake's Network, Sound and Video
technology. This is NOT a demo and this is not an ALPHA, either. If this 
WAS a demo or an ALPHA, you would see monsters moving around, have more maps
to play, and see the neat new effects we're programming in right now.  
Please keep in mind that this TEST is a DOS-ONLY program -- running it from
Win95 may harm performance.  If you run this TEST from Win95, you MUST have
a 16mb RAM system.

There are 3 special documents that cover the 3 important components of the
Quake Engine: VIDEO.TXT, SOUND.TXT and NETWORK.TXT.  Please read these
documents to understand how that subsystem works within Quake.  There are
many command-line parameters listed that you can test for us!

Do NOT distribute this TEST in any way, other than electronically. No
commercial exploitation is allowed, except for distribution purposes. We
do NOT intent for this TEST to be sold in any way, shape or form.

| Bug Reporting |
+---------------+

What we would like from you is to send us (email only) a list of the bugs 
that you find, mostly regarding video problems, sounds problems, or network
problems.  You are invited to send general bug-related information regarding 
the gameplay to the Usenet newsgroup REC.GAMES.COMPUTER.QUAKE.MISC only, 
please don't send us gameplay suggestions directly.

Please send Quake bug-related email to qtest1@idsoftware.com. In your subject
line, please describe the type of problem you are reporting: video, network,
sound or game.  If your email to qtest1@idsoftware.com bounces back to you,
do not resend it -- testing is over for this version of Quake.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Before you even THINK about reporting any kind of bug,
make SURE you read the associated file (NETWORK.TXT, VIDEO.TXT and SOUND.TXT)
and use the bug reporting form contained at the end of that 
TXT file.

| Section 2     |
| Running Quake |
+---------------+

To quickly get into Quake, you simply type "quake" on the DOS command-line,
followed by any command-line parameters you wish to use. After Quake loads,
the console will be displayed. To get Quake to work, you must type in the 
word 'YES' to acknowledge that you agree to the terms and conditions of the
LICENSE.TXT file. After typing 'YES', Quake will execute your command-line
parameters and resume execution.

This "Deathmatch TEST" is heavily biased toward 16mb RAM Pentium-based 
systems. If you are running this TEST on an 8mb RAM system, you will see
degraded performance. An 8mb RAM system is good for running a Dedicated
Server or as Client-only in a Deathmatch session. A 486 system will NOT 
run Quake well, as it has not been optimized for that chipset at this time.

You MUST have a minimum of 8mb of RAM under DOS to run Quake.

We have included 3 maps with this TEST version.  They are named TEST1,
TEST2 and TEST3.  To run a map in Quake, in the console type "map <name>"
and the map will be loaded in.  The ESC key will put away the console. For
example: while in the console, if you type "map test1", map test1 will be
loaded and you will start a game in it.

The map TEST1 is a fine example of our medieval setting. We recommend a
maximum of 4 players on this map.

The map TEST2 is a good map to demonstrate traps and instilling fear of 
lava. Playing with 6 or less players is recommended on this map.

The map TEST3 is an example of our military base setting. We recommend a
maximum of 6 players on this map.

Any map with 8 players on it will be a complete fragfest.


+-------------------+
| Section 3         |
| The Quake Console |
+-------------------+

After you first run Quake and type the word YES (signalling that you've
read the LICENSE.TXT and agree to the terms and conditions therein),
you will be in the Quake console, provided you didn't enter "+map <name>"
on the command-line.  While playing Quake, you can press the ESC key to
bring up the console or put it away.  The console is where you enter all
the commands to change the game state.  Any commands that you can enter
in the console can be entered into the console from the command-line by
putting "+" before the command.

For example, one console command is "map <name>" which will load a map
and start it up.  Starting up a map actually starts a local Server and
a Client.  To have a map load up when Quake starts, from the command-
line, you can add "+map <name>" to the command-line. Then, Quake will
load that map after initialization.  From the command-line, the "+" 
character tells Quake that the following parameter should execute the 
console command after initialization.  Any command-line parameter that
starts with a "-" character is an initialization parameter, such as 
"-nosound" and is not something that can be typed in the Quake console.

The console has a command history just like DOSKEY.  Pressing the up and
down arrows in the console will change to the last command entered. You
can backspace over the command and enter new values if you'd like. There
is also a command-completion function.  By pressing the TAB key, you can
have the console automatically finish the name of the command for you. A
really good example of this is the "vid_describemodes" command that lists
all the video modes available on your system.  Instead of typing that
entire command, merely type "vid_d" then press the TAB key and ENTER.


+---------------+
| Section 4     |
| Playing Quake |
+---------------+

Playing Quake is very much like playing DOOM -- get weapons and kill stuff.
In this Deathmatch TEST, you will find SIX different weapons: the Shotgun
(which you start out with always), Double-Barreled Shotgun, Nailgun,
Chainailgun, Grenade Launcher and Rocket Launcher.  Two additional weapons
are slated for the final release (Lightning Gun and Chainlightning Gun).

There are 3 types of Armor: Green (30% absorbing power), Yellow (60%),
and Red (80%).  You can pick up a weaker type of armor if the current one
you're wearing isn't worth the armor increase the new armor would make.

There are 3 types of Ammo that you can pick up: Shotgun Shells, Nailboxes,
and Rockets.  There are small and large quantities of these ammo types.


+--------------------------+
| Section 5                |
| Launching a Quake Server |
+--------------------------+

First of all, there are two types of Quake Servers: Dedicated Servers and
Listen Servers.  Dedicated Servers are used only for running Quake network
games; they will not display any graphics nor output any sound.  The other,
and most common, type of Server is a Listen Server.  This type of Server
will host a game AND operate as a Client.

At this time, there are only 2 network protocols that Quake understands. 
These are IPX and TCP/IP.  The ONLY TCP/IP packets that Quake understands 
is BWNFS from Beame & Whiteside (this is not a shareware product).  The 
IPX protocol works fine from both DOS and Windows95, so this protocol is
recommended.  Please note that the IPX protocol will NOT work over the
Internet unless a higher-level transport protocol is used.  For more
details, please read NETWORK.TXT.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This TEST does NOT work with the modem.  In addition, we
have not yet tested Quake running over Kali, SLIP, PPP or any other packet
transport protocol.  We would be happy to hear about your success in
getting Quake to run over a phone line, though!

There are two important command-line parameters that you need to use to
start a network Quake Server. The "-dedicated" parameter will cause Quake 
to run in Dedicated Server mode.  Clients can connect to the Server by 
typing "+connect" on the command-line, or by typing "connect" in the 
console. The Quake Console is documented below.

Dedicated Servers will only accept the F12 key as input (which will quit
the Server).  Don't type anything on a Dedicated Server's keyboard except
the F12 key to quit to DOS.

The "-listen" parameter will make your system a Listen Server, which
places a heavier load on your system than normal, so run a Listen Server 
on a fast system. To connect to any kind of Server, type "+connect" on the
command-line or "connect" in the console.

At this time, the only way to start a Server is from the command-line. You
can start a Server on a specific map by typing "quake -dedicated +map test3",
for example.  After the "-dedicated" and "-listen" parameters you can limit
the amount of players allowed into the game by typing a value from 2-8. Thus,
a "-dedicated 2" would allow a 2-player-only game.  ALWAYS make sure you
include the map on the command-line as well, such as "+map test2". You pretty
much will always be starting Servers by typing "quake -listen +map test1" or
whichever map you select.

For example, if you want to start a 4-player-only Listen Server with Client
capability on the map named test2 with a time limit of 5 minutes, you would 
type (on the Server system):

quake -listen 4 +map test2 +timelimit 5

The Clients that want to connect to the Server would type:

quake +connect

IMPORTANT NOTE: Under Win95, sometimes a connect won't work the first couple
times. You should try to connect at least 4 times before giving up.


+-------------+
| Section 5.1 |
| Team Play   |
+-------------+

Normally, Quake is a Deathmatch game in network mode. You can play TEAMS in
Quake if you type "teamplay 1" in the console on the Server.  Then, anyone
that wants to be on the same team must set their "color" to the same value.
For example: if I wanted to team up with Tim against Carmack and Abrash,
I would type "Quake +teamplay 1 -dedicated +map test3" on the Server system
and on my Client system I type "color 1" and have Tim type "color 1" in his
console as well so we're on the same team.  Then, when Carmack and Abrash
join the game, they both would select the same color so they're on the same
team.  Then -- BLOODBATH!

In team mode, shooting your teammate will ONLY STRIP ARMOR POINTS from your
teammate.  Rockets and whatnot will not kill them.  They may scream, but
they will not die.  Unless you crush them with something. :)

To have everyone start the game at the same time, someone can press the
PAUSE key and the game will pause while everyone connects to the Server.
Pressing PAUSE again will start the Team Deathmatch.


+---------------------------+
| Section 6                 |
| Running Quake under Win95 |
+---------------------------+

To run Quake under Windows95, you absolutely need 16mb RAM.  Anything less
and Quake will just quit back to Win95.  To check your system's memory,
open up "My Computer->Control Panel->System".

Some systems will not run Quake in a window.  Run an MS-DOS session
and switch to full-screen by pressing ALT-ENTER.  Then run Quake.

For Quake to properly run as a Server under Win95, you must have an IPX
Networking Protocol installed.  To do this, open up "My Computer->Control
Panel->Network".  Click on "Add->Protocol->Add->Microsoft->IPX/SPX-compatible
Protocol->OK".

Two things you need to be aware of when running Quake from an MS-DOS shell:

1) Do NOT check the box labelled "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" in the Advanced dialog in MS-DOS Prompt Properties when running Quake.  Quake will run jerkily and will sometimes exit for no apparent reason if this box is checked.

2) Set the "MS-DOS protected-mode (DPMI) memory" field in the Memory section of MS-DOS Prompt Properties to either Auto or a value of at least 12288.  Quake will fail to load with smaller values.

If you are having crashing problems running Quake under Win95, try using the
"-nosound" command-line parameter.


+---------------+
| Section 7     |
| Problem Icons |
+---------------+

Quake has 3 Problem Icons that you may see on your screen from time to time.

When you are getting less than 10 frames a second framerate, a turtle icon
will appear in the top-left corner. Size your screen down or change your
screen resolution to 320x200 (vid_mode 0).

WHen you get disconnected from a Quake Server or the network packet flow is
disturbed, you will see a Network Disconnect icon below the spot where the
turtle icon would be.

When you are very low on RAM and are in a complex area, you may see a RAM
chip under the area where the Network Disconnect icon would be. This means
that Quake is running low on available memory and you should size down your
SMARTDRIVE cache size or get more memory.


+---------------------------+
| Section 8                 |
| Default Keyboard Settings |
+---------------------------+

Quake's keyboard controls are very similar to DOOM's with the exception
of a few new commands.

Toggle CONSOLE mode = ESC
Attack = CTRL
Move forward = up arrow
Move backward = down arrow
Turn left = left arrow
Turn right = right arrow
Strafe left = ,
Strafe right = .
Jump/Swim = spacebar and ENTER
Size screen up = +
Size screen down = -
Freelook = \

The "Freelook" command will allow the mouse to control the view angle.
Hold the "freelook" key down and move the mouse around at the same time
and see how your view changes.  Get good at this.


F1 = Clear memory cache and reload map and programs
F2 = Reload map
F3 = View BSP order correctly (debugging)
F4 = View BSP order backwards (debugging)
F5 = Take a screenshot in PCX format
F6 = Turn off drawing speeds (debugging)
F7 = Turn on drawing speeds (debugging)
F8 = Turn monster targeting off (debugging)
F9 = Turn clipping on/off (debugging)
F10 = Turn godmode on/off
F12 = Quit game to DOS


+------------------------+
| Section 9              |
| Quake Console Commands |
+------------------------+

Listed below are many of the most useful Quake console commands. These
commands change various aspects of Quake or give information about Quake.
If you have a different keyboard or mouse configuration, you can place
many of these commands in a text file and have Quake execute these commands
by using the "exec" command.  For example, this is my own personal config
file named ROMERO.CFG:
---------start (not in file)------------
mouse3 +mlook
mouse1 +attack
cl_forwardspeed 320
cl_backspeed 320
bind K_SHIFT +jump
sensitivity 3
scr_conspeed 3000
lookspring 0
hostname RomeroHost
bind	K_DEL			+moveleft
bind	K_PGDN			+moveright
bind	K_ENTER			+showscores
color 2 13
name Romero
---------end   (not in file)------------

When I normally run Quake, I type "quake +exec romero.cfg".  Each line
contains a command you would normally enter in the Quake console, but the
"exec" command can take a file full of console commands and execute them.


Common Server Commands
======================

START A MAP
Syntax: map <name>

The only maps you can run in this TEST are: TEST1, TEST2 and TEST3. Typing
'map test1' will drop whatever map you're in and start up the new map.

CLEAR CONSOLE BUFFER
Syntax: clear

EXECUTE A CONFIGURATION FILE
Syntax: exec <filename>

DISCONNECT FROM THE CURRENT SERVER
Syntax: disconnect

LIST ALL AVAILABLE SERVERS
Syntax: slist

CONNECT TO A SERVER
Syntax: connect
OR
Syntax: connect <slist name>



Game View Settings
==================

SPEED THAT THE CONSOLE SCROLLS UP/DOWN
Syntax: scr_conspeed <value>

DISPLAY DRAWING SPEEDS
Syntax: r_speeds <0/1>

DRAW VIEW AS FLAT-COLORED POLYGONS OR TEXTURE-MAPPED POLYGONS
Syntax: r_drawflat <0/1>

CHANGE COLOR OF DEAD SPACE OUTSIDE A MAP
Syntax: r_clearcolor <0-255; 2 = default>

DISPLAY HOST SPEEDS (MILLISECONDS)
Syntax: host_speeds <0/1>


Keyboard Settings
=================

SET A KEYBOARD KEY TO A SPECIFIC ACTION
Syntax: bind <key> <action command>

Current key names:
K_ALT, K_DEL, K_PGDN, K_PGUP, K_SHIFT, K_CTRL, K_UPARROW, K_DOWNARROW,
K_LEFTARROW, K_RIGHTARROW, K_SPACE, K_ENTER, K_TAB, K_PAUSE, K_ESCAPE,
K_F1, K_F2, K_F3, K_F4, K_F5, K_F6, K_F7, K_F8, K_F9, K_F10, K_F11, K_F12

Make SURE that you use UPPER-CASE for the key names!

Current action commands:
+attack, +jump, +forward, +back, +speed, +moveleft, +moveright, +strafe,
+mlook, +lookup, +lookdown, +left, +right, +showscores, +moveup, +movedown,
+forward2

The "+" character before the action commands means a KEYDOWN event will be
called for that action. A "-" character before the commands will signal a 
KEYUP event instead, but that is mostly useless.

Example: to set the 'g' key to jump, you would type "bind g +jump". Any key
that can't be typed must use an explicit key name as listed above. An example
of this would be to set the CTRL key to strafe left, you would type
"bind K_CTRL +moveleft".

SET YOUR FORWARD MOVEMENT SPEED
Syntax: cl_forwardspeed <value>
The default is 200, maximum value is current value of sv_maxspeed.

SET YOUR BACKWARD MOVEMENT SPEED
Syntax: cl_backspeed <value>
The default is 160, max = sv_maxspeed.

SET YOUR SIDESTEP/STRAFING SPEED
Syntax: cl_sidespeed <value>
The default is 320.


Mouse Settings
==============

SET YOUR FIRST MOUSE BUTTON FUNCTION
