This is the latest version of all released quake utilities as of
september 13, 1996.
Each utility has a seperate directory and VC++ project file.
Be sure to pkunzip -d to get all the directories.
Precompiled versions for win32 are also included.
The .qc source files are not icluded here, you will have to get them
elsewhere.
