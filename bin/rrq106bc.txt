	    Welcome to the Verite port of Quake!

--- Quick Start

	Copy vquake.exe, spd3d.uc, and vq95.bat to your quake
directory (the one that contains quake.exe.) If you already
have vquake.exe or spd3d.uc, make sure the new version
overwrites the old one.
	Type "vquake" to run the accelerated game. Use vq95.bat
when running Windows95 to allow TCP/IP networking.

	NOTE: you *MUST* upgrade your software Quake from 1.01
to 1.06 before running vquake 1.06. You can get the patch file
from id software at http://www.idsoftware.com/dlquake.html.

-- Beta 12 fix
	fixed DOS-only cases where the command buffer was not
	handled properly due to it not being page-aligned.
-- Beta 11 fix
	made sure that enough memory was available to be locked.
-- Beta 10 fixes
	r_drawflat 1 now works.
	reduced stack usage a bit; maybe this fixes weird errors.
	require at least 512K of locked memory to fix v_malloc errors.

-- Beta 9 fixes
	some debugging code was left in; might cause a hang.

--- Known Problems

	Please send me email (walt@rendition.com) if you have
problems with this release that do not occur with the
version of vquake distributed with your 3D accelerator board.
Please include a system description, and how to duplicate the
problem if at all possible. Thanks.

	You must disable UNIVBE if you have it installed. There is no
reason to run it as the BIOS is VESA VBE 2.0 compliant.

	If Microsoft Networking for DOS is running, the game
may hang when it exits.

	If the game hangs or does not appear to run, reboot,
run vquake with the "-nodma" flag and try again. If it works,
then you probably have an older PCI BIOS and motherboard that
does not work with the Verite chip's busmastering DMA.

	Under Win95, you cannot suspend the game and continue
later. Attempts to do so will crash Win95. For the same reason,
you should turn off any screen savers.

	If a window pops up on the screen (e.g., from a Win95
background process like a virus scanner), Win95 will crash.

	We have observed improved network performance when we
turn off the screen saver on the Quake server machine.

--- Cvars
	Note: changing these values will affect your performance
	and visual quality.

	d_mipscale (default 1.0)
		increasing it reduces texture detail for
		more distant objects.

	d_mipcap (default 0)
		increasing it (to 1, 2, or 3) reduces texture
		detail for all objects.

	d_bilerp (default 1)
		setting to 0 turns off texture bilinear filtering.

	d_dither (default 1)
		setting to 0 turns off dithering.

	d_wamp (default 7.0)
		controls amplitude of water warping.

	d_wfreq (default 12.0)
		controls frequency of water warping.

	r_antialias (default 0)
		Use "r_antialias 3" to antialias just about everything.
