	    Welcome to the Verite port of Quake!

--- Quick Start

	Copy vquake.exe, spd3d.uc, and vq95.bat to your quake
directory (the one that contains quake.exe.) If you already
have vquake.exe or spd3d.uc, make sure the new version
overwrites the old one.
	Type "vquake" to run the accelerated game. Use vq95.bat
when running Windows95 to allow TCP/IP networking.

	NOTE: you *MUST* upgrade your software Quake from 1.01
to 1.06 before running vquake 1.07. You can get the patch file
from id software at http://www.idsoftware.com/dlquake.html.

-- beta 5
	fixed bug where aa particles disappeared after a while

-- beta 4
	folded in id's 2/6 release, which fixes at least the
	grappling hook bug (bad entity number)

	Also, if you get a page fault while running vquake, try
	replacing cwsdpmi.exe with the new version in cwsdpmi3.exe.
	Rename the old one to some different name, and then rename
	the new one to cwsdpmi.exe. This has worked for at least
	one person.

-- beta 3
	Fixed bugs:
	alias models get completely wrong textures sometimes (but now
		requires 20Mb minimum to run under windows.)

	some alias model mipmaps show a blue fringe.

	timerefresh under water is amusing.

	weird scanlines generated by some models.

	hardly any particles get drawn.

	if no soundblaster in dos, will hang.

	antialiased particles are in (see r_antialias below.) still not
	quite right, though.

	crashes with some hipnotic levels.

-- beta 2
	Fixed demo-mode rendering errors.
	Known bugs:
		occassional blue stripes in mipmapped textures
		alias models with incorrect textures; apparently
			a texture caching bug as save/load makes it work
		new particles not showing up
		env var BLASTER not being there in dos causes hang

-- Quake 1.07 beta 1
	Ported to id 1.07 source tree as of 1/22/97. Supports
	Rogue and Hipnotic level packs.
	Known bugs:
	Demos show rendering errors not visible during game play.
       	If no soundblaster in DOS, hangs.


--- Known Problems

	Please send me email (walt@rendition.com) if you have
problems with this release that do not occur with the
version of vquake distributed with your 3D accelerator board.
Please include a system description, and how to duplicate the
problem if at all possible. Thanks.

	You must disable UNIVBE if you have it installed. There is no
reason to run it as the BIOS is VESA VBE 2.0 compliant.

	If Microsoft Networking for DOS is running, the game
may hang when it exits.

	If the game hangs or does not appear to run, reboot,
run vquake with the "-nodma" flag and try again. If it works,
then you probably have an older PCI BIOS and motherboard that
does not work with the Verite chip's busmastering DMA.

	Under Win95, you cannot suspend the game and continue
later. Attempts to do so will crash Win95. For the same reason,
you should turn off any screen savers.

	If a window pops up on the screen (e.g., from a Win95
background process like a virus scanner), Win95 will crash.

	We have observed improved network performance when we
turn off the screen saver on the Quake server machine.

--- Cvars
	Note: changing these values will affect your performance
	and visual quality.

	d_mipscale (default 1.0)
		increasing it reduces texture detail for
		more distant objects.

	d_mipcap (default 0)
		increasing it (to 1, 2, or 3) reduces texture
		detail for all objects.

	d_bilerp (default 1)
		setting to 0 turns off texture bilinear filtering.

	d_dither (default 1)
		setting to 0 turns off dithering.

	d_wamp (default 7.0)
		controls amplitude of water warping.

	d_wfreq (default 12.0)
		controls frequency of water warping.

	r_antialias (default 0)
		Use "r_antialias 7" to antialias just about everything,
		including particles.
