This VQuake release is a small upgrade.  Everything in whatever previous
readme you have is probably still true.  This release simply adds one new
setting.

r_surfacelookup (default 1, enabled)

Disabling r_surfacelookup will make the CPU perform the 8 to 16 bit
conversion step for texture maps instead of the Verite.  On faster CPUs
this can increase performance.  Results also depend on what resolution
you choose.  In other words, your mileage may vary.
