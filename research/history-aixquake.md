# IBM AIX Quake History

IBM AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) is a workstation platform running PowerPC CPUs. It runs a flavor of UNIX.

The popular AIX servers and workstation used around the time of Quake was probably the RISC System/6000 (RS/6000).

The port of Quake to AIX was called "AIX Quake" or "AIXQuake".

The AIX Quake port was developed by Bob Foster.

Quake for AIX
Peter Schoenmaker 28 Oct 1996

I downloaded Quake for AIX, and found it runs awsome. You can find it
at ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/games/Quake. There is
Abuse too.
I was wondering if anyone has been able to get it to run the registered
version of the games. I was also wondering if there will be any updates
to 1.06.

Thanks

Quake for AIX/PowerPC (RS6000)
Oliver Fromme
7 Nov 1996

Hi,
If anyone is interested: There is a version
of Quake for IBM AIX/PowerPC (RS/6000). I can't say anything more specific
because I don't have one (but maybe others can share their experiences...?).

ftp://ftp.tu-clausthal.de/pub/msdos/games/quake/

there are the files Quake.bin (just under 16 Mb) and Quake.bin.txt
(installation instructions).

Have fun!

Regards
Olli

The `ftp.software.ibm.com` server where the releases were officially distributed has an HTTP interface for the file system that was archived.

Sadly the content of the `/Quake/` directory was not archived:

The timestamp suggests a June 26th 1997 creation date.

The `ftp.tu-clausthal.de` server mirrored the release and had an HTTP interface to the file system, except the dir was not archived until long after the release (e.g. 1999).

## Quake Shareware for AIX v1.07 (last release)

Released as `Quake.bin`, `quake.sw.tar.Z`, and `quake.sw.just.exe.tar.Z`.


The FTP site was mirrored and some logs were posted to USENET. This gives an idea of the directory content in `ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/games/Quake` shortly after the release:
