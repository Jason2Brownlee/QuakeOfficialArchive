# Amiga Quake History

Reconstructed history of Amiga Quake ports.

This history is particularly challenging to reconstruct, given the mess of ports based on the leaked Linux v1.01 source and the lack of archive of the official port files.

## Releases

* QuakePPC (based on leaked linux src)
	* 1998 Sep 09, QuakePPC9.lha
	* 1998 Sep 16, QuakePPC.lha
	* 1998 Sep 16, QuakePPC10.lha
* 1998 ??? ??, quake060.lha
* 1998 ??? ??, quakedemos.lha
* 1998 Mar 09, QuakePlayer095.lha
* 1998 Apr 02, QuakePlayer096.lha
* 1998 Apr 02, QuakeP_096code.lha




## Amiga Quake Alpha aka "QuakePPC" (Leak)

A port of Quake to Amiga was made using the leaked Linux Quake v1.01 source code.

There were at least two alpha versions (e.g. one using the v1.01 source and an update with 1.06 changes).

Perhaps distributed as:

* Quake.lha
* QuakePPC.lha
* QuakePPC9.LhA
* QuakePPC10.lha

Quake warning from PXL / clickBOOM
PXL / clickBOOM
5 Dec 1997

ILLEGAL QUAKE CONVERSIONS WARNING
Dec. 4, 1997.

Dear Amiga users,

As you probably know PXL computers and clickBOOM are negotiating a license deal
with Id Software where PXL would buy the rights to develop and publish Quake
for the Amiga.

However, numerous Quake hacks for the Amiga have spawned during last several
months. If PXL computers and clickBOOM obtain the license and wish to pursue to
develop and publish Quake for the Amiga, current hacks can tremendously hurt
future sales. This will in return hurt the whole Amiga market, as any hope for
other important conversions will diminish.

Therefore, we would like to inform all Amiga users that once the license is in
place PXL will take following legal actions:

1. Prosecute creators of Amiga Quake hacks.

Amiga Quake hacks are ILLEGAL. No person or company can under any circumstances
own or use the stolen Quake sources to create illegal Quake ports.


2. Prosecute distributors of Amiga Quake hacks.

Distributing Amiga Quake hacks known as "AmigaQuake" , "CoolQuake" , "AmiQuake"
and similar is ILLEGAL. No person or company has the right to use or distribute
this software.

!! If you own or use such software, delete ALL copies promptly !!

Creators and distributors of illegal Quake hacks will be directly linked and
held responsible for loss of sales. Distribution of Quake hacks over the
Internet was monitored for a few months, and all persons and companies involved
in this illegal action will be prosecuted.

After a few years of constant decline Amiga market is finally seeing the light
this Xmas season .
It is therefore a sad fact that piracy can easily shatter any hope for a
brighter future.
The example must be set - Amiga market can not tolerate any more illegal
actions.

If you are an Amiga programmer, and you wish to work on a conversion of a major
game, please contact PXL / clickBOOM first. We will consider obtaining the
license. DO NOT try to convert games illegally! It will hurt and ultimately
destroy Amiga games market.

If you are distributing illegal software you are breaking the law! If you
suspect code to be illegal, or are unsure, DO NOT distribute or use it!

Let's all work together for a brighter Amiga future where big games will be
converted, as well as originate on the Amiga.


PXL computers / clickBOOM

Short:    Quake PPC-Patch was illegal
Replaces: game/patch/QuakePPC.lha
1998-11-06

The Quake ppc-patch uploaded to aminet was not by ClickBOOM,
but anonymous coder. It is based on stolen source code, and
is thus illegal. It is by no means "official" as the .readme
claimed.

P.S. It wasn't even the latest version.. ;)

Err. i just peeked at Clickbooms site, and i said
Quote:
So called "Quake PPC" on Aminet is illegal and not coming from clickBOOM.
This idiotic move by some no-brain imbecil now made it official there will
be no Quake PPC coming from clickBOOM.
No one better even think about flaming us for this decision.
end quote:

5 Nov 1998

The QuakePPC.lha archive on Paderborn Aminet isn't the real thing -
sure, the readme file might claim that it's an official patch from
ClickBOOM, but it ain't - it's just one of the FastQuake pirate
releases. It's identical to either FQ 3 or 4 - same datestamp, same
file size, even same README in the archive. Certainly no patch.


Bablos.

Quake for PPC-Amiga
-------------------

You need v46 ppc.library, get it from phase5 site if you don't have it.
And of course you also need the normal Quake data files, PAK0.PAK and
PAK1.PAK. These should be in id1/ subdirectory.

...

This version is almost completely compiled with EGCS.

     - the anonymous author. :)


---
Little update history, latest additions on bottom:

-Added direct gfx card access. Quake renders directly to gfx card, no
 chunky buffer in fastram!
-Compiled with EGCS
-Removed 68k startup code, everything in ELF
-New c2p system, no more 68k render task, just PPCCallM68k()
-C2P only the modified parts of screen
-Chunky bitmap can have a modulo. This means that width doesn't need to be
 aligned to 64 pixels anymore, and direct cgx access should work with CV64.
-Rewrote render code, it's a bit faster.
-Multiplayer menu doesn't crash anymore if no networking is available.
-Minor optimizations
-Screenmode can be changed on the fly..
-Added Quake v1.06 stuff! This is entirely based on Q101-106.TXT which can
 be found from www.idsoftware.com. I included the text file in this
 release, check the modifications there. Note that there probably are some
 internal changes too which are not listed there, and thus are not present
 in my version either. However, I still decided to bump the version to 1.06. :)

|
`-[-------]-------[7/4/97]-----------[01/01]

****************************************************************************
Hello, this is SHeN_LoNG the leader of DC97'

I have put out this txt because it is due time the rumors and the cloud of
smoke was lifted from a project DC97' has worked on called 'AmiQUAKE'...

Yes, we did have a functional port of QUAKE done on the Amiga. Yes we did
use source code the was not obtained legally. We wernt the ones to actually
steal the code from crack.com blame some lamer PC group for that blunder,
BUT yes we did use what can be called 'stolen source code'...

NOW TO PUT AN END TO EVERY RUMOR ABOUT AMIQUAKE COMMING FROM
THE WEBPAGES AND NEWGROUPS.

-The last version of AmiQUAKE EVER was v.32 which was for the testers only
and did get 'leaked' out by a tester.

-The rumors about v.32+ like v.47/.49/.50 are false they dont exsist no
matter how bad you would like them to.

-There IS NOT a v.50 in 'internal testing' at all, this version does not
exsist.

-The versions of AmiQUAKE dubbed v.47/v.49/.50 that started to do there
rounds on the net are just v.32 with a bullshit doc file and doctored up to
show a new version, ANYTHING HIGHER THEN v.32 IS SHIT, it doesnt exsist.

-YES I.D. Software at one time got in touch with DC97'

-YES I.D. Software gives a shit about our port, they give a VERY BIG SHIT.

-YES AmiQUAKE is now dead, R.I.P., Project terminated. Its gone, please
belive this, there will be no more of the port comming from DC97' at all,
it is dead.

-NO we have not and will not give out the Amiga sources to anyone at all.

-NOBODY is picking up from our port or our source code, NO FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT of AmiQUAKE!

I hope this cleared the air about AmiQUAKE and squashed alot of the rumors
and crap about AmiQUAKE floating around.

-WHY DEAD? The lead coder ^MAX^ has a new girlfriend (He found a damned
hott one at that =) and he also is enrolled full time at a University, plus
he also has a job, which equals no more time for coding or porting. To put
it another way, "It was fun while it lasted" and a big THANX for the fun
goes out to ^MAX^.

Laterz!

### Coolquake

Released 1997, multiple versions:

* CoolQuake 1.41
* CoolQuake 0.73

Subsequent port based on leaked code?

```text
However, CoolQuake (which is now illegal) runs relatively well on a 68060/50 MHz with AGA by lowering the window by half. How will the ClickBoom version be? Optimized, not optimized? Rewritten or simply recompiled? To know for sure, it was better to ask the question directly. Alexander Petrovic, head of development, answered.
```
-- http://obligement.free.fr/articles/quake_amiga_bonne_id.php

```text
Heh, there have been many ports of Quake for the Amiga.

The first ports started appearing after the original Quake source code was leaked. I think the first time I saw Quake run on an Amiga was in about 1996. Some guy had a 68040 powered Amiga with a port of Quake done using the leaked source code.

Several ports of Quake based on that leak were made. If I remember correctly, the first "optimised" port was Coolquake (if I remember the name right). I remember when I got my Blizzard 1230 accelerator for my A1200, I think I got something like 5FPS in 320x256 with the smallest window size

CoolQuake based stolen source

...

Here are some newer versions for those who are curious about pre-Clickboom versions of Quake on the Amiga. Upped to the Zone are QuakePPC V1.01 and CoolQuake V1.41 (presumably for 68K, but untested). Neither are likely to be as good as Frank Wille's ports of Quake, but you have to remember that they date back to 1997/98 and were quick kludges.

29 Sept 1997

Hi!
Just got hold of CoolQuake - Quake for the Amiga with Assembler routines
making it run way faster than AmigaQuake!

Get it from our local computer club's homepage at:

## ClickBoom

The official Quake port for Amiga was created by ClickBoom.

Releases:

* binary
	* quake060.lha
* quakeplayer (demo player)
	* quakeplayer.lha
	* QuakePlayer096.lha
	* QuakeP-096code.LZX
* demos
	* quakedemos.lha

Hot on the heels of Myst is Quake, the next game to receive the porting treatment from ClickBOOM. Interestingly, Quake came 2nd in the voting by Amiga users, with Monkey Island 3 coming first. But I don't mind, as I would rather see Quake.

They expect to release Amiga Quake in February 1998. This suprised me; okay, it may slip a month or two, but it is soon, considering how long it took to port Myst.

Amiga Quake
I saw on PlanetQuake that clickBOOM.com is reporting that Amiga Quake has been approved by id Software, and "As soon as production of material is ready, Quake will ship." There've been some inaccurate reports on the status of Amiga Quake in the past, so I asked id CEO Todd Hollenshead about this, and he confirmed that Amiga Quake will ship soon with id's blessings.

Amiga Quake
Word is that the AmigaQuake ordered through clickBOOM.com is now arriving in the hands of eager amigers. Thanks [OCR]OPA. On the subject of this old soldier that refuses to die (or even fade away), here's a story on Gateway's plans to revive the Amiga Thanks Eric Rose.

QUAKE PLAYER 0.95    -   7.5Mb of free FAST memory and FPU required!
-----------------

This is a non-playable demo of Quake Amiga. However, it is much more than a slideshow,
that is why we call it the Quake Player. It allows you to view Quake demos, both
the ones found in the game, as well as a vast number of demos from Internet.

=================================================================================
Very important: Quake Player does not just display presaved pictures,
IT ACTUALLY RENDERS THE WHOLE GAMEPLAY IN REAL TIME AS IF YOU WERE PLAYING IT !!!
=================================================================================
