## Quake Windows Dedicated Server v1.03

Released as `qwded103.exe` on August 8th 1996.

Announced:

```text
==August 8==

4:50p.m.
WHOOP!! Now I can stay in NT 4 and run the server at night instead of having to reboot into 95. Just got email from Mike Wilson. The Win32 v1.03 dedicated server is on ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/qwded103.exe. Part of the message reads:

This is an unsupported release, but we have
tested it quite a bit over the last few days,
and it seems to be the best Internet Quake
server available at the moment--and of course it
support NT, so it should make a lot of people
happy.  One note:  you have to have the
registered Quake levels to run this dedicated
server.

Also, somebody was wondering how long it normally takes to compile levels. They did dm1.map in 50 minutes on a DX2-66 with 16 megs ram. I haven't tried to compile levels yet.

I just got an email from Mike Wilson, saying "come get Win32 Quake
dedicated server exe", so now that I have it, you come get it too...
http://www.gygabite.com

it's in the "Files" area. It's for registered only, it's dedicated only.
It runs on 95 and NT, NT for coolest performance. Mike said, "Smoothest
Quake Server we've seen yet"

This is an unsupported release of a native Win32 x86 Quake dedicated server.

This archive contains two files:

WINDED.TXT - this file
WINDED.EXE - Win32 dedicated Quake server

WINDED runs as a native app on either Win95 or Windows NT (Intel x86 only),
so you can finally run your server on NT.  In fact, WINDED running on NT is
pretty much the smoothest Quake server we've seen.  Any Quake client should
be able to connect to a WINDED server.

## Quake Windows Dedicated Server v1.04

Released as `qwded104.exe` and `qwded104.lzh` on August 13th 1996.

Announced:

```text

7:40a.m. CDT
id has release v1.04 of their win32 server. You can get it at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/qwded104.exe. The changes are: "Changed from Sleep(0) to Sleep(1) to avoid problems coexisting with Microsoft Exchange server on NT 3.51 (version 1.04)". Hehe...Kraemer must be happy since that change was made for him. I have tried it out (for longer than you think) and it works very well. Thanks to Chris for telling me they finally uploaded it.

August 14th

New Version of Win32 Dedicated Server
Version 1.04 is now available on id's FTP site /idstuff/unsup/qwded104.exe. While I'm at it, in case you are running a server, and aren't aware, John Carmack has asked that you experiment with sv_friction values:

	"I am considering increasing the default sv_friction value for QuakeWorld from 4 to 6 or 8. It might take a little getting used to, but I think it gives more precise control for wide area network play. If anyone wants to run some experiments with different friction levels on a current Quake server, I would be interested in hearing some feedback."

Also, id has released version 1.04 of the Win32 dedicated Quake server, but this only has fixed one minor problem- compatibility with systems that are simultaneously running Microsoft Exchange Server. Supposedly one line of code was changed, from sleep(0) to sleep(1).

Uhh, since nobody I noticed seems to have noticed, QUAKE 1.06 is OUT!! Read what's changed. Get the shareware quake106.zip (9meg), or the patch q101-106.zip (355k). Don't forget about the Win32 v1.06 Server. And you thought I was getting slow in my old age. BTW, I give credit to Notify (part of Symantec's Internet Fast Find package) for keeping me young and swift. Everybody must be having a nice siesta right now. ;) What was that? You say Stomped was supposed to be first? I hate when I do that. ;)

## Quake Windows Dedicated Server v1.06 (minor update)

Released as `qwded106.exe` on October 7th 1996.

Announcement:

```text
==October 8==

5:50p.m. CDT
Got email from Mike Abrash stating this (heh, you paying attention Kraemer?):

	I just uploaded a new winded (still version
	1.06, but a new exe) to our ftp site.  The only
	change is that it does a Sleep(1) instead of
	sleeping half the remaining time until the next
	server slot, which causes the new winded to suck
	up a lot less CPU time than the old one on NT
	3.51.  It shouldn't make any difference on any
	other platform.

New Unix Ports
The following announcement was just sent along by Zoid, which is also posted on ThreeWave:

	Unix Ports - New Release

	Here is the long awaited release of several Unix Quake ports. These got delayed a bit from all the CTF4 work I've been doing.

	The ports all have support for Quake Mission Packs #1 and #2 from Hipnotic Interactive and Rogue Entertainment, respectively. There are four new dedicated Quake server ports as well as a new SVGALib Linux Quake for playing on. The new SQuake for Linux fixes up the middle mouse button problem and some random crashes. It's at version 0.991 off the Quake 1.07 source.

	Please see the Files Section for the ports and to the download them. The quick list is dedicated servers for Linux2.0, BSDI3.0, Solaris2.5 and SCO ODT5. The dedicated servers are all based on the Quake1.07 source and are version numbered at 0.99 for now.
