GL QUAKE BABY!!!!!!!!!! It's out dudz....ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/glquake1.zip (note: old file replaced - 422k). How come nobody tells me these things??????? Also available from my page http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/files/idstuff/glquake1.zip. How come nobody else is posting about it? Here's the readme. You saw it here first folks. Remember, this is for 3dfx cards and some professional OpenGL cards (see readme) and the pros cost >$1500 usually.

6:20p.m. CST
glquake.zip was replaced by ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/glquake1.zip (422k). From my page as before, http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/files/idstuff/glquake1.zip. From John Carmack's .plan:

GL Quake
I was disconnected for a while until sCary rebooted the Internet, so I got to read on Redwood's page that GLQuake (remember this is an unsupported release) is out, while he wondered why nobody else was posting it... it was that darned InternetTM. Anyway, here's what John Carmack has to say about all this in his .plan:

  Jan 22

  A preliminary release of glquake and the 3dfx driver has been put on our ftp site in the idstuff/unsup directory.

  one hour later...

  3dfx gave me a new vxd for glquake that fixes crashing problems on some pentium pro systems. glquake1.zip now contains the current files.

Here's sCary's GLQuake Help.

GL Quake v 0.90 is the first public beta of the OpenGL port of Quake targeted specifically at the 3dfx chipset based video cards. It is possible to run GL Quake through software but you will get no more than 3-5fps even on a ppro200.
There will be more betas released as improvements are made. no there are no dates on when the next beta will be released. you will just have to keep checking this page huh?

August 10, 1997

More New Releases
OK, looks like the team got the GL bug exterminated and released all the shtuff. Please note that you must have the QuakeWorld 2.0 client to connect to 2.0 servers, but the new 2.0 client *will* connect to older servers (with a small movement prediction error). In other words, everyone upgrade now! :)

Something Wonderful!! Quakeworld 2.0/New GlQuake released!!
Sorry I couldn't be specific. :) Morbid and Zoid have outdone themselves!! GO, get the new binaries and enjoy the fragalicious GLFun!

I'll have entries for the new versions in my FAQ soon.. BUT, there's not much changed from the originals in terms of switches.. You MAY notice a 1 or 2 fps drop with timedemo demo2, (in part due to more screen area being drawn with the new status bar) but your overall speed will be higher. Trust me. The new 8 bit palette is BETTER. Timedemo is not a good real-world measurement. Enjoy!!

Note: REDOWNLOAD THE FILES; there was a problem with the OpenGL32.dll files.

Quakeworld! Quakeworld Server! GLQuake!

New GLQuake GLQuakeWorld, QW Server
Okay, the problems abated, here are the missing goodies: the full QuakeWorld 2.0 client install (1.4 MB) which includes QuakeSpy 5.3 and the GL QuakeWorld client, the new GLQuake (269 KB), which, like the GLQW client, uses 8 bit textures for greatly enhanced performance, the QuakeWorld server (221 KB): it should be noted that only version 2.0 clients can connect to 2.0 servers, though the new client can still connect to older servers. Finally, for the UNIX aficionados, here's the Linux client (163 KB) the Linux server (200KB), and the new SVGALib Quake (200 KB).

## GLQuake v0.95, Quake v1.09

Released as `glq8_27.zip`.


```text
August 27, 1997

New GLQuake
Version 0.95 of GLQuake has appeared on id's FTP site, no list of changes is included, but straight from the man's mouth:

  Zoid: The new GLQuake release fixes some errors that were discovered with the Quake Mission packs.

Note: GlQuake requires a 3Dfx card to run with an acceptable frame rate. There is a reason why you get -3fps/second when you try to run it without an accelerator.

New GLQuake Releases
Zoid sent along word that some new GLQuake releases are available: GLQuake 0.97 (393 KB) fixes the sprite bug from the previous version, and adds independent console sizing (such as a 320x200 scaled console when running at 640x480) and support for SGI Multitexture extensions for high-end Voodoo (Obsidian) and other 3D cards. Also newly released is GLQuake for Linux (449 KB) which requires a 3DFX Voodoo Graphics card (not Voodoo RUSH) and Linux 2.0, and finally, GLQuakeWorld for Linux (412 KB), which again requires 3DFX Voodoo Graphics (not Voodoo RUSH) and Linux 2.0. Also available on id's ftp.site.

The new GLQuake .97 is out, and if you have an Obsidian multiple TMU board you will see a boost of up to 200% in framerates. (I'm getting 64fps at 640x480 and 45fps at 800x600 on the 50-4440 and 115fps at 640x480 and 88fps at 800x600 on the 100SB-4440) The speed increase makes for the smoothest play I have ever seen short of an Intergraph workstation. The new GLQWCL will be out soon, Zoid has just a bit more testing to do.

I should point out that the Obsidian 100 series with 2 TMUs doesn't do multitextures; SLI uses both TMUs as one virtual TMU. However the 100SB-4440 does, as it has 4 TMUs. Also, the GLQuake for Linux doesn't do multitextures either.
