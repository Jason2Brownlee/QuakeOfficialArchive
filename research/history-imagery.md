# Quake Imagery History

Releases of quake imagery, e.g. screenshots of the game and editors.

Releases:

* 1995 Aug 05, quakepix.zip, quakegam.zip
* 1995 Aug ??, steve.zip
* 1995 Aug 10, qe_dev.gif
* 1995 Sep 28, qpix.zip
* 1996 Jun 19, qgraphics.zip


## quakepix.zip and quakegam.zip

This was released as `quakepix.zip` on August 3rd and the zip was corrupted. A second version of the archive may have been uploaded as `quakegam.zip` on August 4th. A final version of `quakepix.zip` may have been re-uploaded on August 5th.

Perhaps something like:

* 1995 Aug 03, `quakepix.zip` (corrupted)
* 1995 Aug 04, `quakegam.zip`
* 1995 Aug 05, `quakepix.zip` (fixed)

A version of the pictures from `quakegam.zip` were brightened and distributed as `quakeidx.zip` and `quakeidx.txt`.

For example:

* https://dukeworld.com/idgames/misc/quakeidx.txt
* https://dukeworld.com/idgames/misc/quakeidx.zip

A copy of this "mod" was distributed as `quakegam.zip`, for example:

```text
QUAKEGAM.ZIP   1188643  17/11/1995
Pictures about QUAKE, same as quakepix.zip
but gamma-corrected, or in other words not so
dark. Quake is not actually spending half its
time clearing memory. :) Get this instead
of quakepix.zip.
```

Announcement and discussion:

```text
   finally, on august 5th, 1995, a series of much awaited early
screenshots were released by id software. they can be obtained from
id's ftp site at

      ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip

   or viewed on their web site at

      http://www.idsoftware.com/qss.html

   these screenshots show the architecture of the levels that can be
built with the new engine (levels over levels and vertical sloped are
seen e.g.) as well as certain lightinng effects (shadows e.g.) but
the only monster to be seen is a dragon flying through the air out
of the distance. likewise, no status bar is visable either, merely a
red '100' at the bottom of the screen (probably the players health).

   i was truely amazed by the screenshots and anyone who wasn't should
consider that we are not seing the actual game in motion, but merely
still images. i'm sure quake will be more than 'just another doom' as
skeptists have been saying.

Hi All,
Why no postings about idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip? (or did

From the quake FAQ:

```text
5 - Are the screenshots for the game?

Yes. As of August 4th, 1995, id released a first series of
screenshots, revealing some of the level building capabilities of
QUAKE and one of the monsters, a red dragon. They can be obtained
from their ftp site at

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip

or at a mirror such as

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip

Further mirrors can be found in the 'List of DOOM FTP/WWW sites',
periodically posted to rec.games.computer.doom.announce.

The screenshots can also be viewed via World Wide Web at id's web
site described in section 10 of this minifaq.

Icarus!
5 Aug 1995, 5:00:00
Well, I downloaded the Quake screenshots from ftp.idsoftware.com in the
idstuff/quake directory. I tried the quakepix.zip file first, but they
were too dark so I grabbed quakegam.zip.
They were EXCELLENT! I only wished that I was able to see the DOOM
and QUAKE screenshots "side-by-each."

I loaded the tiffs up with Photomagic and converted them to gifs, then
gamma corrected them (A little to much on q16.gif, I'm afraid) and used
lview to make an index. I guess that the Romero never checked out the
alt.binaries.pictures.* ;-) heirarchy, and thus never considered
making an index. <Of course I'm joking, don't be an ass!>

Quake screen shots
Released August 3rd, 1995

Here they are - at long last!  The very first screens shots of Quake, taken at 320x200 resolution.  Screens q15.tif and q16.tif are high-res 640x480 24-bit TIFF color screens, just so you can see the awesome lighting. The cool Quake lighting can be seen in all these screen shots (except the de1m5-? ones, which are DOOM screen shots) and a couple sprites and an Alias model as well.  We don't have any Alias models working in the game at this point, but we're >this< close to getting them fully implemented with movement, proper light sourcing and animation. Screen q6.gif has our dragon hovering above a bridge above a moat.

## steve.zip

An encrypted file name `steve.zip` was uploaded to the id software FTP, perhaps in August 1995.

The file was acquired and cracked. The password was `poole`, and intended for Steve Poole at PC GAMER magazine.

The archive was discovered to contain new screenshots of the game.

There is a lot of chatter about the release on USENET, for example:


```text
Perry Michael James
9 Aug 1995

It said in the text file that they don't have the ALIAS models quite working
yet and that is why there isn't anything in the pictures. You apparently
haven't seen the steve.zip pictures with the closeups of the dragon/wyvern
and a knight.

"Steve" Quake Screenshots
mto...@eskimo.com
10 Aug 1995

Shortly after id posted the quake screenshots to their ftp server, they
posted another file name "steve.zip" in the quake directory. According
to the "steve.txt" file, the zip file was encrypted and was intended for
steve (who knew who he was).
Anyway, some intelligent and generous soul decrypted the file and
attempted to post the decrypted zip file to alt.binaries.doom. I was
only able to access some of the parts of the file, and was only able to
salvage one picture "QUAKE13.TIF." This is a 640x480 hi-res screen shot
that shows the dragon and one other sprite.

A link to the picture is posted on my home page:

http://www.eskimo.com/~mtomas

If anyone has any of the other "Steve" screenshots, please post them to
alt.binaries.doom or post how they are otherwise accessible.
```

The shots you're describing sound like the ones from the steve.zip file.
In case you don't know about this (this was a couple months back), id
posted a password protected file called steve.zip on their ftp site.
Someone figured out that the password was poole (the shots were
apparently intended for Steve Poole at PC GAMER for his Quake cover
story (some of the shots appeared in PC GAMER.) I have the steve shots
on my HD. The steve shots weren't as impressive as the quakepix ones
(IMHO), but they did show some interesting stuff. There were very
close-up pictures of the dragon. There were also shots of ramps and
bridges and some other cool stuff. If you want to see the pics, I think
they have a copy of the steve.zip file at the gaming oasis, they did
last time I was there. Sorry, but I don't remember the URL. You could
probably find it by looking at the links on some Doom web pages.

## qgraphics.zip

Released as `qgraphics.zip`.

The release included if software logos, Quake logos and a true type font (TTF) used for the game.

It is possible that some of the images were unpacked and released along-side the archive, such as `qdigi.jpg` and `qpaper.tif`.


Announcement and discussion:

```text
==June 20== 3:00p.m. CDT
I put the Quake True Type Font here for download. It's also on ftp.idsoftware.com and it's mirrors in /imagery.

10:20a.m.
There is a new logo on id's ftp site mirrors. It's originally a 661k jpeg, but I shrunk it down to a 38k jpeg so I could let you take a look at it. Click here to see it. The last entry in Carmack's log yesterday "* created 0.9 SW RC distribution "!!!! WHOOP!!! :) It's so close that I'm about to explode. ;)
