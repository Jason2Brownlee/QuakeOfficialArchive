Hi All,
Why no postings about idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip? (or did
my newsfeed die this morning?)

I've downloaded the quake screenshots from both ftp.idsoftware.com and
ftp.cdrom.com but both are reported as corrupt when I try to unzip them.
Has anyone been able to unzip this file?

Additionally, id released the sources to Wolfenstein-3D ! :-)

From the quake FAQ:

```text
5 - Are the screenshots for the game?

Yes. As of August 4th, 1995, id released a first series of
screenshots, revealing some of the level building capabilities of
QUAKE and one of the monsters, a red dragon. They can be obtained
from their ftp site at

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip

or at a mirror such as

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/quake/quakepix.zip

Further mirrors can be found in the 'List of DOOM FTP/WWW sites',
periodically posted to rec.games.computer.doom.announce.

The screenshots can also be viewed via World Wide Web at id's web
site described in section 10 of this minifaq.

Readme snippet:

Quake screen shots
Released August 3rd, 1995

Here they are - at long last!  The very first screens shots of Quake, taken at 320x200 resolution.  Screens q15.tif and q16.tif are high-res 640x480 24-bit TIFF color screens, just so you can see the awesome lighting. The cool Quake lighting can be seen in all these screen shots (except the de1m5-? ones, which are DOOM screen shots) and a couple sprites and an Alias model as well.  We don't have any Alias models working in the game at this point, but we're >this< close to getting them fully implemented with movement, proper light sourcing and animation. Screen q6.gif has our dragon hovering above a bridge above a moat.

## steve.zip

An encripted file name `steve.zip` was uploaded to the id software FTP, perhaps in August 1995.

The file was acquired and cracked. The password was `poole`, and intended for Steve Poole at PC GAMER magazine.

The archive was discovered to contain new screenshots of the game.

There is a lot of chatter about the release on USENET, for example:


```text
Perry Michael James
9 Aug 1995

It said in the text file that they don't have the ALIAS models quite working
yet and that is why there isn't anything in the pictures. You apparently
haven't seen the steve.zip pictures with the closeups of the dragon/wyvern
and a knight.

"Steve" Quake Screenshots
mto...@eskimo.com
10 Aug 1995

Shortly after id posted the quake screenshots to their ftp server, they
posted another file name "steve.zip" in the quake directory. According
to the "steve.txt" file, the zip file was encrypted and was intended for
steve (who knew who he was).
Anyway, some intelligent and generous soul decrypted the file and
attempted to post the decrypted zip file to alt.binaries.doom. I was
only able to access some of the parts of the file, and was only able to
salvage one picture "QUAKE13.TIF." This is a 640x480 hi-res screen shot
that shows the dragon and one other sprite.

A link to the picture is posted on my home page:

http://www.eskimo.com/~mtomas

If anyone has any of the other "Steve" screenshots, please post them to
alt.binaries.doom or post how they are otherwise accessible.

The shots you're describing sound like the ones from the steve.zip file.
In case you don't know about this (this was a couple months back), id
posted a password protected file called steve.zip on their ftp site.
Someone figured out that the password was poole (the shots were
apparently intended for Steve Poole at PC GAMER for his Quake cover
story (some of the shots appeared in PC GAMER.) I have the steve shots
on my HD. The steve shots weren't as impressive as the quakepix ones
(IMHO), but they did show some interesting stuff. There were very
close-up pictures of the dragon. There were also shots of ramps and
bridges and some other cool stuff. If you want to see the pics, I think
they have a copy of the steve.zip file at the gaming oasis, they did
last time I was there. Sorry, but I don't remember the URL. You could
probably find it by looking at the links on some Doom web pages.
