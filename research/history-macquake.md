# MacQuake History

Referred to as "Mac Quake" or "MacQuake".

I believe there were unofficial ports (based on Linux src leak) then an official port by Westlake Interactive.

MacSoft version????

Quake (Feb.7)
Westlake Interactive is working with MacSoft to provide a bug fix update of Quake Mac. We're currently working on several bugs, including networking issues, sound and CD audio problems on G3's and other Macs, and input sprocket issues, to name a few. Keep checking back for updates on the patch!

## MacQuake Alpha (Unofficial Port aka HackQuake)

Perhaps at least versions, e.g. alpha 1 and alpha 2.

Perhaps distributed as `PPC_Quake_a2.bin` or `MacQuake.sit.bin` or `MacQuake a2 Installer.1.bin`, etc.

Big update, apparently a MacQuake alpha is floating around the net. No, I do not have it, nor do I want it, and no I will not send it to you. I would advise against downloading it for many reasons, the first and foremost in my mind is that you damage Lion, second, many warez files contain viruses, and thirdly alphas can seriously screw your comp up.

Now, knowing that people will be screaming to know if it plays well, I've posted two anonymous letters concerning the alpha. Enjoy, and don't warez.

	I just "aquired" a copy of MacQuake PPC Alpha Version 2, and I have to tell you that it run's _well_ on my 6100/60! (It's comparable to when I play Quake on my 486/66 PC Card.)

	Since this is still a very early version (It has _no_ Mac interface, no sound, etc...) I can only expect that performance will improve by the time it's ready to ship!

	I'd just like to tell fellow Mac users, this game is going to be worth the wait! The PowerPC hardware was designed for games like Quake ;)

Second letter....

	The current version Macquake alpha 2 does not posess networking, mac ui or sound, but the game play is there. The current version I have played indicates it was created on February 12th, 197 and contains the basic first episode of the shareware version. All monsters and weapons appear to be in place. I played through four levels and was quite impressed with how far it has come. The controls still lack mouse support and you cannot use the keypad for movement. Also none of the F-keys work yet either.

MacQuake
There is a pirated version of a MacQuake alpha floating about, according to MacQuake News. If my sources are correct, there were concerns that this alpha would be leaked (it was being demonstrated at some trade show), so it's fairly crippled. Thanks Jason Keeley.

ROTFL! It seems that the MacQuake alpha that's been leaked is not Lion's code at all, though it still remains a *possiblity*. The alpha is more than likely a quick and dirty port from stolen quake source code that was taken from crack.com.

Lion is looking for a copy of the alpha so that they can verify whether or not the code is theirs. If you would like to give me some info so I don't have to scrounge around for it, I would appreciate it.

I received this letter a few mintues ago, which seems to be confirmation of the "non-Lion" alpha. I have forwarded this to Lion, but since they have not substantiated it yet, right now it's heresay. I will post Lion's official response as soon as it arrives.

	Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 15:57:59 -0700
	From: `Burn
	Reply-to: `Burn
	Organization: E-Mail Anonymous
	X-Sender: Anonymous Mail Script
	To: Jason Carter
	Subject: MacQuake "alpha" leak.

	For one, this is an anonymous email script, so don't write back asking questions.

	Myself and a friend did the port, which actually was quite easy (Carmack codes pretty portably already). We are now working on the sound code, which will be done soon. We hope to make a better port than Lion. ;) Yes, we ported the stolen source from crack.com. Anyways, thought you could use a little more information on the "alpha" leak. Our code is in no way affiliated with Lion's, except for the fact that it's based on the original id source. I might email you in the future with updates. Any questions? Put 'em on the page.

	Hasta la pasta,

'Burn responds to yesterday's letter:

	I would like to note that this is a "for fun" project, to see what can be done, etc. We did not intend to release it, in fact we just just gave it to a few friends to check out... and well, you know how things go, especially when people are spooging over a game like Quake. We are not trying to undermine or in anyway hurt Lion's business, we were just trying to get Quake to run on a Mac, for our and our friends' enjoyment.

	To Lion: we'd be happy to send you what we've done, and what we are working on now, etc.

Mac Quake Alpha Location
Garret Huntress
1 Mar 1997

For the past week, I have been searching for MacQuake Alpha. The
closest that I have come is an outdated link: PPC_Quake_a2.bin. If you do
know a location where it is available, please e-mail me. I don't care if
it doesn't have the interface features or it can't quit, who would want to
quit it anyway.

There was an unofficial port of Quake 1 to Mac OS long before the official retail version. Any of you heard about this? Supposedly someone had stolen the DOS source code from the servers of the company CrackDotCom, and ported it to Mac. This was how everyone on Mac played Quake 1 at first. It was distributed very heavily over the server/client BBS-style software "Hotline". This version of Quake 1 was usually referred to as "HackQuake". I can probably dig up a copy of the application. It's a pretty rough port. Very laggy and has some occasional crashes. The particle effects from grenades & rockets caused substantial lag. Still, when this was the only way to play Quake, it was good enough for the time being. Especially since it was playable over the net, and against DOS/Win players as well of course.

Current Quake Technical issues, April 9, 1997.

If you have trouble with weird colors or incorrect textures in 1.09, throw away all the files inside the "glquake" folder in the "id1" folder to fix the problem.

Quake Technical issues, December 5, 1997.

If you get a message regarding the "gfx.wad," move the "Quake" folder to your desktop and attempt to run the program with the folder in that location. This has worked for some users. Our programmers are working to remedy this problem.

Modem and Serial play have been fixed in version 1.08.4
