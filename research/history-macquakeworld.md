## Mac QuakeWorld Started

```text
QuakeWorld (Mar. 23)

Westlake Interactive has begun the conversion of QuakeWorld to Macintosh. Due to the strong demand for a Mac version of QuakeWorld, MacSoft and Westlake are going to jointly fund the conversion of QuakeWorld to the Mac, as well as update the Mac version of Quake to the latest version of GL Quake (.97). Once completed, these updates will be available for free.

The GLQuake update should come fairly soon. Due to Westlake's other time & resource commitments a release schedule for QuakeWorld is unavailable at this time.

Report bugs to qwbeta@westlakeinteractive.com, remember no technical support is provided for QuakeWorld, it is a free unsupported add-on for registered Quake owners.

QuakeWorld (June 22)
There are a few known bugs in QuakeWorld 2.21b1 Mac, including joining servers with non-default ports (not 27500) and having players quit from a server without disconnecting. We are planning on fixing all reported bugs, but right now we are extremely busy with final Unreal beta testing, so unfortunately the next QW beta release is going to delayed a while.
