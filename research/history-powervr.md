A pair of new drivers for you guys that just love that GL experience:

* New PowerVR drivers for Quake, Quake2, and Hexen2 have all been released on the VideoLogic Homepage. I gotta give the PowerVR guys credit where it is due, they are ALWAYS working on ways to squeeze more performance and kill bugs. Great job in supporting the users. -Blue's
