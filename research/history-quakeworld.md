QuakeWorld Server Distribution Plan
Disruptor (Christian Antkow), the QuakeWorld main man, and master of the master-server, let me know that the Revco page has a very significant update: The news that the Server software would be distributed in advance of the client software ("soon"). This of course only makes sense, otherwise five minutes after the client is released we'll have 5,000,000 users trying to log into two servers. Shortly after that I got word from the source of the distribution (who'll remain nameless, not that anyone around here likes to hound people), filling me in on the plan, and I am comfortable that this is going to work out with a minimum of bloodshed. Stay tuned for further details...

QuakeWorld Newsflash Part III
There's a new update to the RevCo page pointing out that the first batch of clan skins have been released (also available on on Stomped). Thanks for that to Ozzie.

The RevCo page was updated earlier with Disruptor's QuakeWorld server docs and this note (thanks Greg_Gibson aka angryHelmut):

Expect the server to be uploaded "shortly"

Here are the server documents in text and HTML formats.

QuakeWorld Server Released
Get qwsv1213.zip here or from id's ftp site or Stomped, and the first batch of clan skins right here. Here are the server documents in text and HTML formats. (Thanks to Don Peterson and Benjamin Alexander for spotting the screwed links). To install the skins, create a \quake\qw\skins\ subdirectory and unzip this file into it.

## QuakeWorld v1.25 (client)

Released as `qwcl1217.zip`.

QuakeWorld Client Released
Here's the moment you've been waiting for, the QuakeWorld Client (1.4 MB). Here's the read me, the server (202 KB), the server read me, the new base skin file (17 KB), and the new skins file (1.4 MB). By the way, everyone who couldn't stand waiting a second longer for the client owes a large debt to Christian (and others I'm sure), who toiled all the way through the night on this.

Here is the lowdown from id Software's Michael Abrash on the "Cannot load wdirxxf.dll" message.

	"Unless you want to run -dibonly (which is usually slower, and is a lot slower at low-res such as 320x200), you *must* have all 6 files (wdir62.dll, wdir62f.dll, pmpro62.dll, pmpro62f.dll, wdirnop.com, and wdirnop.pif. You must also have the latest versions, dated 12/9/96."

Michael asks that everyone avoid distributing just qwcl.exe (or at least, if you do, not to send him or John Carmack mail asking why things aren't working).
