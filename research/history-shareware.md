>>>>>END QUOTE<<<<<

It's very pretty, but I'm real disappoted about the speed. It needs an FPU, but
how much it relies on it I don't know. I thought most modern programmers
avoided floating point like the plague.

Anyway it's out :)

Quake FTP list!
Ka On Lee
24 June 1996

Followup-To: rec.games.computer.quake.playing -- moderator]
This is the ftp list I got from www.idsoftware.com. I post it here since
you may have some hard time to access that site or some popular mirrors.
Hopefully one of them will let you in.

I have downloaded the 7 disks version from
ftp.wustl.edu/pub/MSDOS_UPLOAD/Quake/

Haven't try it yet.


From www.idsoftware.com

We split QUAKE into files that will fit on 1.44 mb floppies so you can copy
each file to a disk for backup purposes, or to give to a friend who doesn't
have internet access (just in case you need someone to beat on in deathmatch).
All seven disks are required to install QUAKE.
The filenames for the 7 disks are: qsw091_1.zip to
qsw091_7.zip. Alternatively you can download one huge .zip
file called quake091.zip.

Now available at:

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake/
...
```

======================================================
==                 Version History                  ==
======================================================
v1.00 -- Bugs fixed
------------------------------------------------------
* Gravis Ultrasound audio support (still has bugs)
* More deathmatch start spots on E1M6 and END
* Print server version and PROG CRC on connect
* -dedicated starts start.map if nothing else specified
* fixed lookspring function during net game
* fixed rare crash during long running dedicated server
------------------------------------------------------
v0.94 -- Bugs fixed / Features added -- LIMITED BETA VERSION
------------------------------------------------------
* Totally rewritten menus
* New lighting model with overbrighting
* Parsed lowercase BLASTER parms
* Better Sound Blaster shutdown code
* Rewrote BLASTER initialization
* Fixed DMA channel 0 bugs
* Added SBPro 8 stereo setup
* Fix delayed sound on 8 bit Sound Blasters
* Fixed speed key affecting angle-turning from keyboard
* Fixed "no such Alias frame" bugs
* Fixed Zombie not getting up bug
* Checked for very high joystick values, signalling a failed read
* Unstuck jumping Fiends and Spawn
* Fixed large BModels blinking out in complex areas
* Fixed s_localsound with no sound started
* Saved spawn parms in savegame
* Fixed screenshot save location
* Bind with no arguments no longer clears value
* Allow console in intermission / finale
* Fixed false gib messages
* Full-screen TAB scoreboard in DeathMatch
* Fixed "+playdemo <demo>" from command line
* Trapped overflow in sizebuf messages
* Moveup / movedown in water!
* Fixed-up Talk command
* Added unsupported crosshair option ("crosshair 1" from console)
* Colored chat messages with notify sound
* Fixed "connect during intermission" bug
* Changelevel while demos running no longer crashes
* Fixed changelevel with no map left up loading screen
* Fixed long names entered from the console causing crash
* Stopped demos changing while in the menus

* Fixed modem initialization from menu
* Fixed serial reliable stream getting stalled
* Serial/modem code fixes
	16550a lost transmit buffer empty interrupts
	fixed sometimes processing interrupts from com1 when using com2
	added com3/com4 support from menus
	fixed first character of modem init not getting sent
	saved serial/modem settings in config.cfg
* Fixed name and colors not always sent to server at startup
* Fixed "stopdemo" crashing the system when there wasn't a demo playing
* Added server's TCP/IP and IPX addresses (if available) to status command

* In 0.92, an additional check for a usable VESA video mode was added;
the numpages field was verified to be greater than 0, and no mode was
supported that had numpages set to 0 (which indicates that there's not
enough video memory for that mode).  ATI's VESA driver, m64vbe,
reports 0 for numpages, so VESA video modes that were available in 0.91
were no longer available in 0.92.  This extra numpages check has
been removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.93 -- Never officially released; internal testing only.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.92 -- Bugs fixed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Typing long strings in the hostname or modem init field in the menus caused
crashes.

Under Win95 IPX was detected but not functional, resulting in the game
exiting to DOS.

If -nosound, got "S_LocalSound: can't cache" on every keypress in the menu.

When vid_nopageflip was set to 1 in VESA modes, going underwater resulted in
only the upper left corner of the drawing area being updated.

The single player scoreboard (tab) printed text incorrectly in all modes
greater than 320 pixels wide.

On network connections that dropped packets, the reliable message stream
could get stopped up, resulting in frag counts and talk messages no longer
being delivered, although game movement continued.

The com port settings from the menu were getting saved & restored but
not used.

Direct serial connections did not work with slist.

Quake now checks the vesa information for hardware incabable of page-flipping.

Menu sound sometimes didn't play.

Q95 (qlaunch.exe) frequently failed to execute on the first attempt.

Q95 (quakeudp.dll) was running out of buffers when running a server.

Teams were not being set according to pants colors.

QUAKE 1.01 RELEASED
Adnan Zafar
13 July 1996

Quake v 1.01 was released yesterday. I heard about it at about 10:40 P.M..
It fixes the modem code, it doesn't allow anyone to leave the level is
deathmatch, and it fixes the fraglimit and timelimit. You can get it from
id's ftp site, stomped's ftp site, and walnut creek's ftp site. There is
no patch to go from 1.00 to 1.01 ready yet so you will have to download it
all over again.
Happy Quaking

Uhh, since nobody I noticed seems to have noticed, QUAKE 1.06 is OUT!! Read what's changed. Get the shareware quake106.zip (9meg), or the patch q101-106.zip (355k). Don't forget about the Win32 v1.06 Server. And you thought I was getting slow in my old age. BTW, I give credit to Notify (part of Symantec's Internet Fast Find package) for keeping me young and swift. Everybody must be having a nice siesta right now. ;) What was that? You say Stomped was supposed to be first? I hate when I do that. ;)

=======================================

This is the Quake v1.06 full shareware release.  We will also be releasing
a patch for registered users.  If you are a registered user and you are
reading this, then you've probably already downloaded it, so just copy over
your existing files to upgrade.

In addition to new .exe files, progs.dat, located in pak0.pak, has been
updated as well, so be sure to copy over your \quake\id1\pak0.pak file.


If this is your first Quake Shareware download, then unzip all files to a
\temp directory.  Then run the file 'install.bat' and it will guide you
through the installation process.
```
