# Solaris Quake History

Quake clients for Solaris or "SolarisQuake"

SPARC is the hardware by sun Microsystems and Solaris is the operating system running on this hardware.

This excludes the dedicated servers and QuakeWorld servers starting circa March 1997 by Zoid.

Releases:

* Dave D. Taylor port circa 1996?
* quake1.09-sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1.tar.Z


## Dave D. Taylor port circa 1996

Comments on a Solaris port circa 1996.

Perhaps a dedicated server rather than a client?


```text
The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor using X11 on July 5, 1996,[4] followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor.

```text
Before the public release of the source code by id Software ports were developed with license from the developers, Dave Taylor one of the employees of the company at the time developed the first ever port to the Linux operating system on July 5, 1996. Later followed by a SPARC Solaris port later at the same year.

Probably did not happen:

 spoke to ddt a few months back (actually over a talk session, but close
enough) and asked about any planned ports of Quake to Unix platforms,
and he mentioned SGIs and Linux boxes. When I asked about a possible
Solaris port, his approximate response was, "Ugh...yeah, we'll probably
end up porting to Solaris too, but not without a great deal of reluc-
tance." At the time he had already moved on to Crack, but was still in
touch with Carmack about the ports and so on - so unless any of this has
changed (which wouldn't surprise me) I imagine a Solaris version is
somewhere in the making.
