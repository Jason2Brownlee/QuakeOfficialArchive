your Quake v1.00 directory and type PATCH.  Make sure that the files in
your v1.00 directory haven't been modified before installing the patch,
or you will get errors.

February 28, 1997

I've also been told that the Scourge of Armagon pack does exist by emails, but apparently there are also a lot of places that don't have the pack and some (Computer City) that don't appear to be carrying it at all. People have been saying good things about the pack, but I'll reserve my opinions until after I actually see/play it (who knows when). There's a DOS/Win combo executable for Quake 1.07. VQuake also does not work with the packs at this time (probably has to do with 1.07 being required). Thanks to everybody that wrote in about it.

Quake 1.08 (Updated)
As pointed out earlier, the ever vigilant Frans P. de Vries of the 3D Action Gamers' Archive discovered that without much (any?) fanfare, Quake 1.08 (205 KB) has appeared on id Software's FTP site. There's only the executable (dated March 11, 1997) and nothing else. For those keeping track at home, new versions of Quake since 1.06 have appeared in subtle ways (thanks to all that wrote in to clarify this Wesley T Morrison being the first): 1.07 is the version of Vérité Quake that supports the Mission packs, 1.08 was included in Mission Pack #2, and 1.09 is the latest version of GLQuake. Matthias Buecher points out that version 1.08 will load 1.06 saved games, which 1.07 would not.
