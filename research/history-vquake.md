# VQuake History

Rendition Verite port of Quake referred to as "VQuake" or "Verite Quake".

Rendition is the company, Verite or "Vérité" is the 3D graphics chipset also referred to as "Rendition's V1000", the 1996 era version. See [Rendition, Inc., Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendition,_Inc.s).

A handful of video cards used this chipset and VQuake allowed those cards to run/render Quake optimized for this chipset.

> V Quake is a port of Quake for graphics cards using the Vérité chipset, created by Rendition. There are currently four graphics cards that use the Vérité chipset: The Screamin' 3D by Sierra, Intense 3D 100 by Intergraph, 3D Blaster by Creative Labs, Total 3D by the Canopus Corporation, and Stealth II from Diamond Multimedia. These cards are generally more affordable than graphics cards using the 3Dfx chipset, but they are also not as strong. GL Quake provide better 3D rendering of images than V Quake. However, V Quake is certainly a showcase for the ability of the Vérité chipset.

I Was Just Wondering About That
I love my Vérité enhanced Quake, but was starting to wonder what the deal was with new versions, since it is already outdated at version 1.01. Well thank you to Jeff Phillips who passed along this email he got from John Carmack answering that very question:
	"We will be releaseing a new 1.06 vquake. Dunno when."
Makes me fell a little better.

October 23rd

Vquake Beta
Thanks to Mike Boich of Rendition for telling me that there's a beta version of Vquake (Vérité-enhanced Quake) available on Rendition's site.Because I had such a long download, I've stored it (and fixed the corrupted zip--sorry) locally here at Blue's (251 KB). Obviously, this is of no use to you if you do not own a Rendition Vérité-based video card.

Own a Vérité based 3D accelerator and play Quake? Get the beta v1.06 vquake from Rendition's web site. Thanks to Eric Busch for telling me about it. He also says: "It doesn't really have an effect on timerefresh scores, but the overall gameplay is much more fluid. Gone are the annoying slowdowns I experienced when walking around corners or through doors (Mike Boich said this was probably due to textures being loaded). I now find 512x384 (about 18fps at the start) to be very playable on my P120."

New Vquake 1.06 Beta
Thanks to my pal Erick Cid aka PrIeSt.[HSM] for passing along the new beta of Vérité-enhanced Quake v. 1.06. I guess this is a good time to point out PrIeSt is actually the one who alerted me to the last beta, but I screwed up and didn't credit him. Once again, a reminder that you need a Vérité-based video card to use this.

Vquake Beta Pulled
I got a message from Walt Donovan saying that the Beta 4 of Vquake 1.06 had been pulled from Rendition's FTP site. Beta 4 turned out to be an interim release that was an attempt to solve a users problem with the GUS. Walt says:

	"...I'm still working on fixing reported bugs and there may be minor performance tweaks ahead as well."

As long as they fix the "disappearing texture bug," I'll be happy (though performance enhancements are always welcome).

VQuake
VQuake 1.06 Beta 12(!) has been uploaded to Rendition's site. Thanks to HurtQuake for letting me know when they put up the link (last night), and to Randy Perry for letting me know when there was (finally) a file to download (this afternoon). There's still a bit of confusion, as the file I downloaded was 272 KB, while the site lists its size as 639 KB (but the archive seems complete, so...).

	What's new since Beta 10:

	fixed DOS-only cases where the command buffer was not handled properly due to it not being page-aligned.
	made sure that enough memory was available to be locked.

	Also, if you get a page fault while running vquake, try
	replacing cwsdpmi.exe with the new version in cwsdpmi3.exe.
	Rename the old one to some different name, and then rename

	one person.

-- beta 3
	Fixed bugs:
	alias models get completely wrong textures sometimes (but now
		requires 20Mb minimum to run under windows.)

	some alias model mipmaps show a blue fringe.

	timerefresh under water is amusing.

	weird scanlines generated by some models.

	hardly any particles get drawn.

	if no soundblaster in dos, will hang.

	antialiased particles are in (see r_antialias below.) still not
	quite right, though.

	crashes with some hipnotic levels.

-- beta 2
	Fixed demo-mode rendering errors.
	Known bugs:
		occassional blue stripes in mipmapped textures
		alias models with incorrect textures; apparently
			a texture caching bug as save/load makes it work
		new particles not showing up
		env var BLASTER not being there in dos causes hang

-- Quake 1.07 beta 1

New VQuake
Hot on the heels of the lengthy post mentioned earlier about Vérité Quake comes a release of a new version. Here's beta 1 of VQuake 1.08 (259 KB), as described in this message board post by author Stefan Podell. Thanks David McKean. Here's what's new:

	This VQuake release is a small upgrade. Everything in whatever previous readme you have is probably still true. This release simply adds one new setting.

	r_surfacelookup (default 1, enabled)

	Disabling r_surfacelookup will make the CPU perform the 8 to 16 bit conversion step for texture maps instead of the Verite. On faster CPUs this can increase performance. Results also depend on what resolution you choose. In other words, your mileage may vary.
