> Yes, you read the headline correctly, Winquake .99 (v1.07)is finally here!! Windows NT users can rejoice! Download wq099.zip (315k) from here, or get it from ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/wq0991.zip (it's there now). Here is the readme. Remember, this is an unsupported release. Hopefully the supported version will be out shortly. Before you fire up that email to me with some problem you have, please read the entire readme file first to see if your problem is addressed. Look for me to have some Help for frequently asked questions (that aren't already answered in the excellent readme) up a little later tonight.

The release included a zip archive `wq0991.zip` and perhaps a separate readme `wqreadme.txt` on the id software FTP server in the directory `/idstuff/unsup/`.

It appears that the news was later updated to include the v0.991 release "wq0991.zip".

The release was then announced on BluesNews the next day

## WinQuake v0.991

The WinQuake v0.991 release was announced on Redwood's Quake Page on February 11, 1997.

> February 11, 1997

> D'OH! I kinda fell asleep at the wheel. My ISP had a fit around 8pm and I couldn't get outside of it so I took a nap for "just a minute". Next thing I know, Kraemer is calling me at 11:30. Anyway, Mike Abrash gave me permission to release this updated version of WinQuake (v.991) after I did some final testing, which I just finished (thanks to Loren and Sage for assistance). Go get http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/files/idstuff/wq0991.zip (316k). Here's a list of the fixes listed in the also updated readme:
>
>> Fixed problem with pre-1.07 (DOS) clients connecting to WinQuake.
>> Got rid of "Starting Quake..." dialog when running -dedicated.
>>
>> Added -novbeaf switch to turn off VBE/AF support in case of problems, and updated documentation.
>>
>> Corrected Scitech's U.S. Mail address in documentation.
>>
>> Added joystick bug decriptions and workarounds.

> WinQuake
> Thanks to Redwood for riding shotgun on the buggy WinQuake situation. Here's WinQuake 0.991 which will allow 1.06 clients to attach to 1.07 servers (which also means that server operators should now consider running WinQuake -dedicated rather than WinDed). Red's also updated his WinQuake FAQ (thanks to DaKoTa of Clan Xenocide).
