## WinQuake v0.99

The WinQuake v0.99 release was announced on Redwood's Quake Page on February 5, 1997.

> Yes, you read the headline correctly, Winquake .99 (v1.07)is finally here!! Windows NT users can rejoice! Download wq099.zip (315k) from here, or get it from ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/unsup/wq0991.zip (it's there now). Here is the readme. Remember, this is an unsupported release. Hopefully the supported version will be out shortly. Before you fire up that email to me with some problem you have, please read the entire readme file first to see if your problem is addressed. Look for me to have some Help for frequently asked questions (that aren't already answered in the excellent readme) up a little later tonight.

The release included a zip archive `wq0991.zip` and perhaps a separate readme `wqreadme.txt` on the id software FTP server in the directory `/idstuff/unsup/`.

It appears that the news was later updated to include the v0.991 release "wq0991.zip".

The release was then announced on BluesNews the next day

> Thanks to Redwood for the word that WinQuake .99 (314 KB) has been released as an unsupported product...

## WinQuake v0.991

The WinQuake v0.991 release was announced on Redwood's Quake Page on February 11, 1997.

> February 11, 1997
> 2:30a.m. CST

> D'OH! I kinda fell asleep at the wheel. My ISP had a fit around 8pm and I couldn't get outside of it so I took a nap for "just a minute". Next thing I know, Kraemer is calling me at 11:30. Anyway, Mike Abrash gave me permission to release this updated version of WinQuake (v.991) after I did some final testing, which I just finished (thanks to Loren and Sage for assistance). Go get http://redwood.gatsbyhouse.com/files/idstuff/wq0991.zip (316k). Here's a list of the fixes listed in the also updated readme:
>
>> Fixed problem with pre-1.07 (DOS) clients connecting to WinQuake.
>> Got rid of "Starting Quake..." dialog when running -dedicated.
>>
>> Added -novbeaf switch to turn off VBE/AF support in case of problems, and updated documentation.
>>
>> Corrected Scitech's U.S. Mail address in documentation.
>>
>> Added joystick bug decriptions and workarounds.

It was then announced on Scary's Quakeholio:

> WinQuake
> Thanks to Redwood for riding shotgun on the buggy WinQuake situation. Here's WinQuake 0.991 which will allow 1.06 clients to attach to 1.07 servers (which also means that server operators should now consider running WinQuake -dedicated rather than WinDed). Red's also updated his WinQuake FAQ (thanks to DaKoTa of Clan Xenocide).

properly.

```

Mirrors of the release on other FTP sites suggest that the readme file was not shared in the `idstuff/unsup/` directory for this, and probably prior releases.

## WinQuake v1.00

The WinQuake v1.00 release was announced on Redwood's Quake Page on March 21, 1997.

> March 21, 1997
> 5:10p.m. CST
>
> Coincidence? I think not! Thanks to Disruptor for letting me know that Michael Abrash finished WinQuake 1.00 (Quake v1.09. Yes, as opposed to 1.07). Thanks to my friends that assisted me in some heavy duty testing the last two days so he could get that done. Also to the internet Quakers that unwittingly tested the dedicated server on quakeworld.insync.net (206.222.163.150), which I co-admin. Download wq100.zip (337k) Check the readme for some of the things that got fixed (it's at the end). Just quick note before the email pours in about it, you must specifically enable the joystick now. Type joystick 1 at the console and it will save that from then on.

A changelog was added to the bottom of the file and changes in the file were listed as version 0.994 instead of 1.0.

I suspect that the release was changed to v1.0 after Michael Abrash, the maintainer, announced he was leaving id software.


```text
*** WinQuake 0.994 ***

Fixed bug where in some cases involving IPX, whenever a new person
entered the game, a current player got dumped.

Added DirectInput mouse support, and the -dinput command-line to
enable it.

Added -notriplebuf to disable triple buffering to work around
possible problems with some modes on some DirectDraw drivers.

Added remembering last window position, and restoring that, rather
than centering the window, whenever WinQuake runs in a window.
Can be reset with the -resetwinpos command-line switch.

Added the vid_minimize command, which minimizes WinQuake if and only
if the current mode is windowed.

Made it so WinQuake no longer gets suspended when Alt-Tab is used to
switch away from a fullscreen session.  The means you can Alt-Tab
away from fullscreen WinQuake without losing a connection to a
Quake server.

Added vid_nopageflip console variable to turn off page flipping, and
documented page flipping problems this can be used to work around.

Documented that Del-Ctrl-Alt (in that order) causes WinQuake to
fault on Win95.

Fixed the winsock TCP/IP driver so it will not cause a dial-up
internet connection to automatically start up when Quake is started.
If you start Quake with the internet connection already active, there
will be no difference.  If you start Quake with it inactive, the
connection will be activated when you either try to connect to a
server or search for local servers.

The local IP address will not always be known at startup now.  If it
is currently unknown the menu will display "INADDR_ANY".  This
will be replaced with the real address when it is known.  The IP
address will become known when: you try to connect to a server,
you search for local servers, or you start a server.

For multi-homed machines (machines with more than one network
adapter and IP adress), you can now force WinQuake to bind to a
specific IP adress.  There is a new command line option "-ip" that
takes an IP address as its parameter.

Added vid_fullscreen_mode and ability to select that mode by
clicking on the maximize button.  Added two commands:
vid_fullscreen to switch to vid_fullscreen_mode, and
vid_windowed to switch to vid_windowed mode.

Changed joystick default to disabled; now it only works if the
joystick cvar is set to 1; however, this setting now remains in
effect permanently.  Added joystick documentation below.

Documented dprint only works if developer set to 1.

Documented scrunching of MS-DOS windows on Alt-Tab.

Documented that NT versions earlier to 4.0 are not supported.

Added DirectInput support for devices such as First Person
Gaming's Assassin controller.  All buttons should now
be configurable in WinQuake.

Fixed bug where when low-res fullscreen DIB modes selected from
the menu sometimes ran very slowly or produced garbled displays.

Fixed bug where 1.06 and earlier save files couldn't be loaded
by WinQuake.

Removed "Net play pauses every few seconds" bug; it was determined
not to be a bug, just an artifact of network play.

Noted that even when BIOSes do have VESA 2.0 built-in, it's often
so buggy that WinQuake crashes in faster configurations, and that
SciTech Display Doctor is the easiest way to get reliable VESA
support.

Added note on Alt-Tab only working if Tab released first.
