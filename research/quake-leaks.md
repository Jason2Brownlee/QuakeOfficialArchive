## Quake Press Release / Quake Pre-Release v0.9 or vo.91?

### Quake Wiki

They call it a "Quake Pre-Release"

https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Beta3

> A slightly modified version was released in the interim between the original Beta3 and the official release of Quake, known as the Quake Pre-Release. Besides a few minor changes to documentation, the only in-game change is the simplification of the console. Instead of including artwork, the Pre-Release version just has a solid grey background.

## Quake v1.01 Source Code Leak

### Beta Archive

Request for Quake 1.01 source and NextStep 3.3 Developer CD.
https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30195

> This code was leaked back in 1997

> By mere chance I had found this rare piece of gaming history. It was the source to the 1.01 build of Linux Quake. Dave Taylor was porting Quake to Linux and their (crack.com) web server was hacked. It was a notable incident. Now that the engine is OSS, I don't think it would be an issue to have though it is great for story telling.



Infamous source leak of Linux Quake 1.01
https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22882

> This is the source code to the Linux build of Quake 1.01 that Dave Taylor was porting. It was taken during an infamous server break in at Crack.com. Back in those days , this was a huge incident. The incident is mentioned in this interview (March of 1997)

> DT: Yeah, we got broken into. Our resident source code got sniffed out, packed up, and released.
