Quake Leaks

We don't endorse or want these leaks.

We intentionally do not host any leaked material in this archive!

We just want to know what was leaked and when for a complete history.

What do we know?

## Quake Press Release / Quake Pre-Release v0.9 or vo.91?

### Quake Wiki

They call it a "Quake Pre-Release"

https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Beta3

> A slightly modified version was released in the interim between the original Beta3 and the official release of Quake, known as the Quake Pre-Release. Besides a few minor changes to documentation, the only in-game change is the simplification of the console. Instead of including artwork, the Pre-Release version just has a solid grey background.

## Quake v1.01 Source Code Leak

### Beta Archive

Request for Quake 1.01 source and NextStep 3.3 Developer CD.
https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=30195

> This code was leaked back in 1997

> By mere chance I had found this rare piece of gaming history. It was the source to the 1.01 build of Linux Quake. Dave Taylor was porting Quake to Linux and their (crack.com) web server was hacked. It was a notable incident. Now that the engine is OSS, I don't think it would be an issue to have though it is great for story telling.



Infamous source leak of Linux Quake 1.01
https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22882

> This is the source code to the Linux build of Quake 1.01 that Dave Taylor was porting. It was taken during an infamous server break in at Crack.com. Back in those days , this was a huge incident. The incident is mentioned in this interview (March of 1997)

> DT: Yeah, we got broken into. Our resident source code got sniffed out, packed up, and released.



### Wikipedia

Quake (video game)

> ... An SVGAlib port for Linux was created by programmer Greg Alexander in 1997 using leaked source code but was later mainlined by id ...

huh.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)



### Various

* there was a hack of "crack dot com" and linux src for v1.01 was stolen and distribyted
* squake is based on a patch from this code by Greg Alexander
* fisheye quake used the src
* AmigaQuake used the src
* macquake (hackquake) used the src

> Dave Taylor only ported the game to X11, but thanks to the Quake source code being stolen from the Crack dot Com server, coder Greg Alexander was able to finish a port to SVGALib in just twenty four hours.

> Alexander even had the chutzpah to submit the patches to John Carmack, who graciously accepted them without the threat of legal action.


Hackers Hack Crack, Steal Quake

https://archive.is/jgzqr

> HACKERS BROKE INTO the Web server and file server of Crack dot Com, a Texas gaming company, on Wednesday, stealing the source code for id's Quake 1.01, as well as Crack's newest project, Golgatha, and older games Abuse and Mac Abuse.
...
> The hackers, who identified themselves as being from the group FEH ...

Happened on the 8th of jan 1997



Linux Quake Port
https://academickids.com/encyclopedia/index.php/Linux_Quake_Port

> Shortly after, crackers who had compromised Crack dot Com's server stumbled upon the virgin Quake source and copied it, distributing it among the Quake community underground. Dave Taylor reacted to the news by threatening legal action in Quake community IRC hangouts.

...

> Linux enthusiast Greg Alexander happened upon the Quake source, saw that someone had begun the underpinnings of a more serious Linux Quake port to SVGAlib and decided to complete it himself. In 24 hours, Quake was running on Linux. In spite of Dave Taylor's intent to prosecute, Alexander submitted the patches to John Carmack, lead programmer of id Software.

> An SVGALib version was also later produced by Greg Alexander in 1997 using recently leaked source code, but was later mainlined by id.[34] Later id products continued to be ported by Zoid Kirsch[35] and Timothee Besset,[36] a practice that continued until the studio's acquisition by ZeniMax Media in 2009

https://www.shacknews.com/cortex/article/844/cquake-part-5-source-ports-and-fisheye-quake

> Before all that - before the offical source release - the Quake source code was hacked and leaked onto the web. In a Alpha Geek move, someone used the leaked code to create a Linux port of Quake. Carmack forbid id Software from suing the port maker, and the unofficial port was used as a foundation for the offical Linux port! Another product of the leaked source code was Fisheye Quake - our subject today. The developer, Wouter van Oortmerssen, held back the public release of Fisheye Quake until after the source code was released officially, avoiding all the legal drama.

https://strlen.com/gfxengine/fisheyequake/index.html
Wouter van Oortmerssen

> I initially made this hack using the quake 1.01 source code for linux (illegally obtained), and later ported it to the GPL-ed win32 code released by id software.


fisheye readme:

> I just love fisheye, and when I stumbled across a leaked copy of the quake
source code (for linux, version 1.01) I just couldn't resist. To avoid being
sued by id I couldn't release it though, so best I could do was screenshots
and AVIs on my homepage... highly irritating as some people even thought they
were merely fakes, warped in photoshop. Then in december'99 came the official
source code release so I could finally release the code.


https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22492

> There was an unofficial port of Quake 1 to Mac OS long before the official retail version. Any of you heard about this? Supposedly someone had stolen the DOS source code from the servers of the company CrackDotCom, and ported it to Mac. This was how everyone on Mac played Quake 1 at first. It was distributed very heavily over the server/client BBS-style software "Hotline". This version of Quake 1 was usually referred to as "HackQuake". I can probably dig up a copy of the application. It's a pretty rough port. Very laggy and has some occasional crashes. The particle effects from grenades & rockets caused substantial lag. Still, when this was the only way to play Quake, it was good enough for the time being. Especially since it was playable over the net, and against DOS/Win players as well of course.


https://virtuallyfun.com/2018/06/08/quake-1-01-shareware/

> I saw this pop up while cruising archive.org, and I thought it’d be fun to play with.Â  The shareware version of Quake on this CD image is version 1.01, which corresponds with the crack dot com leak of the Quake source code.Â  Searching around revels that the leak was aptly named “Quake101leakedsource.zip”, which wasn’t so hard to track down.

> This has only maybe one- or two-hundred (maybe three-hundred?) lines of my own code in it, but this is definitely the pride and joy of the lot of them. I got an illegal copy of the Quake source code rather shortly after it was hacked. I noted that there was the DOOM version of the Linux svgalib driver (at the time, the Linux port of Quake only ran under the X Windowing System, which was slower and didn't support mouse as well, among other things) included in the package, so I ported it to work with Quake. 24 hours after recieving the source (almost on the dot!), I E-Mailed John Carmack (the primary author of the Quake engine) a patch and told him what I had done (crossing my fingers, hoping he wouldn't send the Secret Service after me). He accepted the patch. After a few days, he decided (partially beacuse of me) to take an amateur volunteer to do Unix ports of Quake. I was second on the list (the guy who was first on the list, Zoid, already had a Non-Disclosure Agreement with id). Regardless, my code made it into an official id product. Because it was the first (apparently) official id product to be released by someone other than id (Zoid did the official release), it was the first to go into the /quake/more_idstuff directory on ftp.cdrom.com. Zoid, the guy who finished the port after I deleted my copy of the source (I was yelled at by the ex-id Software employee who runs the site which was hacked), mostly just added Linux CD-ROM support (I do not have a CD-ROM drive :)) and is claiming much more credit than is due either me or him (John Carmack deserves most of the credit -- he made Quake so portable that it was a breeze).
